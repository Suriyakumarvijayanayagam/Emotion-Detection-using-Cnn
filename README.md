
Emotion Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):

This project aims to classify emotions in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It takes images as input and predicts the corresponding emotion label.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is the XYZ Emotion Dataset, which consists of a large collection of labeled images representing different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Please refer to the dataset documentation for more information on its structure and licensing.

Dependencies:
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or above
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-classification-cnn.git
cd emotion-classification-cnn
Prepare the dataset:

Organize the dataset into the following structure:

bash
Copy code
emotion-classification-cnn/
├── dataset/
│   ├── train/
│   │   ├── happy/
│   │   ├── sad/
│   │   ├── angry/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── validation/
│   │   ├── happy/
│   │   ├── sad/
│   │   ├── angry/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── happy/
│   │   ├── sad/
│   │   ├── angry/
│   │   ├── ...
Train the CNN model:

Run the following command to train the CNN model on the training dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train.py

This will train the model using default hyperparameters and save the trained model weights to a file.

Evaluate the model:

Run the following command to evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This will calculate the accuracy and other performance metrics of the model on the validation set.

Predict emotions:

Use the trained model to predict emotions on new images by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Replace path/to/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to predict the emotion for. The predicted emotion label will be displayed in the console.

Model Architecture:

The emotion classification model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the XYZ Emotion Dataset and optimized using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

The detailed architecture and hyperparameters of the model can be found in the model.py file.

Results:
The trained model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set. For more detailed evaluation results, please refer to the evaluation_results.txt file.
